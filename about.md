I'm a lapsed microbiologist, now working as Head of Digital Content at Pimoroni
creating [learning materials](https://learn.pimoroni.com/?term=sandyj), keeping
the [online shop](https://shop.pimoroni.com/) spick and span, and dreaming up
hair-brained schemes for our
[Bilge Tank](https://www.youtube.com/pimoroniltd) YouTube show.

In the past, I've studied for a PhD looking at iron acquisition and its role in
the virulence of *Pasteurella multocida* causing pneumonia in cattle, at the
Moredun Research Institute. I've also worked as a postdoc, building metabolic
models of the nutritional symbiosis between aphids and their bacterial
symbionts *Buchnera*.

Until early 2016, I worked as a bioinformatician as part of the Centre for
Chronic Diseases and Disorders at the University of York, contributing to a
range of projects from cancer to parasitic infections to ancient dental
pathogens.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with electronics, especially the Raspberry
Pi, photography, and reading graphic novels. Useless and eclectic skills
involve balloon modelling, juggling, throwing pots, and silversmithing.
