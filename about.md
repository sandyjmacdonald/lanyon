title: About

I'm a scientist - a microbiologist by trade - now working as a bioinformatician at the University of York.

In the past, I've studied for a PhD looking at iron acquisition and its role in the virulence of *Pasteurella multocida* causing pneumonia in cattle at the Moredun Research Institute. I've also worked as a postdoc, building metabolic models of the nutritional symbiosis between aphids and their bacterial symbionts *Buchnera*.

Now, I work as a bioinformatician as part of the Centre for Chronic Diseases and Disorders at the University of York, contributing to a range of projects from cancer to parasitic infections to ancient dental pathogens.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with electronics, especially the Raspberry Pi, photography and reading graphic novels.
