I'm a scientist - a microbiologist by trade - now working as a bioinformatician
at the University of York.

In the past, I've studied for a PhD looking at iron acquisition and its role in
the virulence of *Pasteurella multocida* causing pneumonia in cattle, at the 
Moredun Research Institute. I've also worked as a postdoc, building metabolic 
models of the nutritional symbiosis between aphids and their bacterial 
symbionts *Buchnera*.

Now, I work as a bioinformatician as part of the Centre for Chronic Diseases 
and Disorders at the University of York, contributing to a range of projects 
from cancer to parasitic infections to ancient dental pathogens.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with electronics, especially the Raspberry 
Pi, photography and reading graphic novels.
