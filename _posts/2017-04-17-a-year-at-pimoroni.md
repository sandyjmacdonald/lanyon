Here's a whirlwind tour of my first year at Pimoroni.

It was under slightly odd circumstances that I joined Pimoroni. I'd been working
at the University of York for eight years, during which time I'd had several
different contracts, and I'd taken a year out in the middle to study for a
Masters in Computational Biology. In the latter four years at the University,
I'd been working day-to-day analysing various groups' data in the Biology
department, all sorts of different projects from prostate cancer to tropical
diseases to ancient dental plaque. I loved it.

At the beginning of 2016, I was nearing the end of another contract and had just
applied for a new position working on a project to build a web database of
_E. coli_ mutants, funnily enough with my first PI (Principal Investigator;
basically boss) in York. I applied, and was given an interview. The
interview went really well and I was offered the job. Obviously, it wasn't that
straightforward...

I'd been tinkering with Raspberry Pi bits and pieces since the Pi went
mainstream, and Pimoroni was where I fuelled that habit. In fact, Jon told me
once I was at Pimoroni that I was probably one of the biggest spending
customers! After blogging a few of my projects with Raspberry Pi, Jon invited
me over and we came to agreement that I'd contribute tutorials, when I could, to
the Pimoroni learning site. I also spent a day using the Pimoroni laser
cutters to cut some pieces for my modded Picade, and then appeared on Bilge
Tank to show it off.

The day before my interview for the new contract in York, Jon got in touch and
asked if I'd come to work at Pimoroni as Head of Digital Content! For me, it
came completely out of the blue. I told Jon that I was going to have the
interview for the position in York, and then I spent a couple of days agonising
over what to do. It really was an incredibly tough decision to make. On the one
hand, I'd been offered a new position at the University of York, somewhere I
loved working, although it was another fairly short-term contract. On the other,
I'd been offered a completely new and exciting position at a company whose
products I loved, with the opportunity to tinker with electronics and also put
my programming, writing, and teaching skills to use.

I went with probably the more risky option; I think you know what I chose! It's
now a year on, and what a year it's been. My job was to take charge of the
learning resources, producing new and exciting tutorials, and making it easier
for absolute beginners to get started with the Pi and with our add-ons. Through
the year, that grew to include photography and some video, and some product
design as well.

## Three Pi launches

Before I'd properly started at Pimoroni, I'd been told by Jon, under NDA, that
the Pi 3 was launching. He'd asked if I'd write a rundown of it's features and
do some benchmarking of the new on-board Wi-Fi, so I put together a blog post
replete with graphs of performance.

That was the first of three Pi launches during my first year (not including
the slightly revised A+ and the Compute Module 3). Next was the new version of
the insanely popular Pi Zero, now with camera connector, and again I put
together a blog post about it with details of the hardware changes.

Probably the biggest launch of the three was the new Pi Zero W, which launched
at the end of February on the Raspberry Pi birthday. The built-in wireless LAN
and Bluetooth were a deal-breaker, we thought, so we spent quite a bit of time
and effort putting together new project kits - really polished little kits that
you could build, program, and make them your own. More on them later.

## Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit

The aim of our Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit was to produce an all-in-one kit in a
beautiful box that wouldn't look out of place in a high street shop, complete
with a really in-depth getting started guide to teach you the basics of setting
up your Pi, playing Minecraft, and installing and programming our Blinkt! LED
board.

I spent a lot of time with Lydia, our head of design, designing the booklet and
trying to make it as friendly and approachable as possible for beginners, and
doing some photography to go on the retail packaging showing the kit being used
and all of the bits that were included.

The kit's been very popular and we hope that it's introduced a lot more people
to the world of Raspberry Pi and physical computing.

## Maker Faire Berlin

In October, a large crew of us set sail (figuratively) for Berlin to attend
Make Faire Berlin. It was my first time visiting Berlin and it's safe to say
that I loved it. The Maker Faire itself is a full weekend of everything
maker-related, from electronics to knitting, jewellery-making to drones, and
much more besides.

We had a stall selling all manner of goodies, and a suitably large number of
demo stands with our trademark blinkenlights! It was lovely to see the
enthusiasm that the Berliners had for our products, especially the demo Picade
that had a throng of kids (and grown-up kids) round it for the whole weekend.

After the Maker Faire we had a few days down-time to relax and take in the
sights. Berlin's such a lovely city to just wander around, with beautiful
architecture and obviously packed full of history, albeit pretty harrowing
history.

My highlights were the afternoon I spent visiting some war-related sights -
the striking Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, the Topography of Terror,
Checkpoint Charlie and the Berlin Wall - and the Nordic Embassies.

The Nordic Embassies visit had been a suggestion of Phil and Daisy and, to be
honest, I hadn't expected to enjoy it nearly as much as I did. The buildings
themselves were stunning pieces of architecture, and they had an excellent
exhibition of Scandinavian design.

## Android Things

The Android Things project was our most top-secret, hush hush project of the
year. We'd been approached by Google to make an add-on for the Raspberry Pi that
would showcase their new Android Things platform on the Raspberry Pi. The idea
was to introduce developers to the world of Android on embedded, single-board
computers like the Raspberry Pi.

The result of all the hard work was Rainbow HAT, a product that was
quintessentially Pimoroni, with three (!!) different sorts of blinky lights,
sensors, and buttons. As we put it, a "buffet of sensors, inputs, and displays
to explore Android Things.

I spent a few days putting together some really nice-looking lifestyle photos
of Rainbow HAT, a really thorough getting started guide, and a blog post about
it. One of my aims in the past year has been to do more of these sorts of
photos of our products, in a consistent way, to create a smart-looking
series of photos that show off how beautiful our products are.

## Pi Zero W kits

Here's the story of how the Pi Zero W kits came to be. We'd known that the Pi
Zero W was coming for while, although we weren't exactly sure when until around
the beginning of the year. We'd got the neat little plastic boxes that the kits
come in with a view to using them for something, although we weren't quite sure
what yet. The Zero W gave us the perfect excuse.

After some brainstorming, we came up with the idea of three project kits and a
starter kit. Each would fit neatly in the plastic kit box, and have all of the
bits you'd need to build the project, and there would be build guides and
tutorials to show you how to put together and use each kit. We had to do all
this in just a couple of months.

The kits were: Pirate Radio, Mood Light, and Scroll Bot. Not only did we have
to design the Perspex pieces for the kit, we had to design two whole new pHATs
(our smaller-format Pi add-on boards) to go with the Pirate Radio and Scroll Bot
kits. Lydia and I bounced back and forth designs for the Perspex pieces, with
Lydia making them look beautiful, while I ironed out the practicalities of the
designs for the laser cutters. It seemed like I spent a couple of hours every
day for a couple of weeks cutting prototypes on the lasers.

Lydia designed some colourful and classy branded bands to go around the kit
boxes, and I took some photos and video of each of the kits, to go on the back
of the bands and to use on social media and such.

It's fair to say that the kits have gone down a storm. No spoilers, but we've
got another super-fun one coming soon!

## Friday afternoon hacks

One thing that I've been doing for myself is to spend an hour or two each week,
if I can spare the time, usually on a Friday afternoon, doing some hack-y
projects involving our products. As well as being just plain fun, the idea is
to show people how they can use our products as part of bigger projects.

The first of these that I did was the Internet of Seeds with the IKEA VÃ¤xer
hydroponics system. I attached our Flotilla Weather, Motion, and Light sensors
as well as
