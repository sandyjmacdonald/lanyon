Piano HAT is Pimoroni's fifth HAT for the Raspberry Pi. It has 16 capacitive
touch buttons, 13 of which are piano keys (a full octave), 2 of which shift the
octave up or down, and the last of which changes instrument. Of course, since
they're just cap. touch buttons, you can have them do whatever you want by
changing their assignments in the Python library provided. There's also a
small white LED for each key on Piano HAT, that can either light up when each
key is pressed or you could program them to light up in other ways, for instance,
to pulse in time to the beat of your music like a metronome.

# Styling

As with the previous four HATs, Piano HAT uses Pimoroni's signature black PCB,
which is especially appropriate for a piano. In addition to the white keys, the
Framboisedorf logo at the top and the text on the keys are exposed from the
copper layer of the PCB. There's a nice little signature at the bottom of the
board acknowledging Zachary Igielman - who designed the Pi Piano upon which
Piano HAT is based - and Phil Howard from Pimoroni.

# Software

Piano HAT comes with a Python library that you can either clone from GitHub
and use the usual `sudo python setup.py install` or use a Bash script that
you can download and run with `curl -sSL get.pimoroni.com/pianohat | bash`.

The library has a few example scripts to get you started, showing you how to
detect button presses and light the LEDs, a learn to play example using the LEDs
to guide the notes pressed, a simple piano (that also has drum noises as a
separate instrument) and a midi piano that outputs midi either to a software
synth or a connected midi device.

The simple piano just uses a series of .wav files that are bound to each key, so
the duration of each note is fixed and won't sustain if you hold your finger on
the key. As I said there are also drum sounds that can be used by switching
instrument with the instrument key. Adding a new instrument is as simple as
adding a new folder with another series of .wav files (or .ogg files).

The midi piano example steps things up another notch. Because it generates midi,
it has none of the limitations of the simple piano example. Notes have proper
durations dependent on the length of key press and you have pretty much
limitless control over the sounds generated. You can use any software synth
that will work in Linux, although I found Yoshimi to be the easiest to set up
and use.

#Â Setting up the Yoshimi software synth

It's a mild pain in the butt to get Yoshimi set up and working with Piano HAT,
but following the steps below should get it all up and running.

{% highlight bash %}
## This installs everything.
sudo apt-get install python-dev libasound2-dev swig
git clone https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi
cd python-midi && sudo python setup.py install
sudo apt-get install yoshimi
curl get.pimoroni.com/i2c | bash
sudo apt-get install python-smbus
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/cap1xxx.git
cd cap1xxx && sudo python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/Piano-HAT.git
cd Piano-HAT && sudo python setup.py install

## This gets Yoshimi and the Piano HAT midi example running.
sudo amixer cset numid=3 1
jackd -dalsa -n4 -r44100 -p512 &
yoshimi -K -a &
cd examples
sudo python midi-piano.py
{% endhighlight %}

# Setting up a hardware synth

Setting up a hardware synth with Piano HAT isn't much more difficult than
setting up a software synth, since all that's happening is that your midi is
going out through USB rather than to the software synth.

Essentially, all you have to do is run the `mididumphw.py` command and then add
the midi device name to the list in the `midi-piano.py` example that reads
`supported = ['yoshimi','SunVox']`.

There'll be a separate post coming soon that will go into more detail about
using Piano HAT with a hardware synth and hopefully have a couple of videos.
