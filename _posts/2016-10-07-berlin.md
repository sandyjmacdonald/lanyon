An early start on the 01:38 train from York got me to Manchester airport just
after 4 am for the 07:00 EasyJet flight to Berlin Schönefeld airport. It was my
first time visiting Germany, although it's always been somewhere I've wanted to
visit. We (Pimoroni) were travelling to Berlin to attend Maker Faire Berlin for
the second year running.

## Maker Faire Berlin

This year, Maker Faire Berlin was being held in
[Station Berlin](http://www.station-berlin.de/en/), a former postal
railway station. Arriving on the Thursday morning to set our stall out, the
emptiness of the two large halls made it apparent just how large the venue was.
The hall that we were in was curved, I guess to fit the curve of the former
railways tracks, while the other hall was more rectangular in shape.

![Station entrance](/assets/station-entrance.jpg)

Our boxes, full of merchandise and display materials, were already waiting there
for us, and it took us about four hours to get everything set up. Our stall was
next to James Mitchell's (and friends')
[Raspberry Jam Berlin](http://raspberryjamberlin.de) stall, that
was full of fun demos, some of which featured our products, such as a set of
Mote lights, the colour of which could be controlled by a Skywriter, and a
Unicorn HAT running a Game of Life simulation.

I'd put together demo boards for some of our products and, like James, I chose
to feature heavily those with blinkenlights because who can resist the lure of
blinkenlights? We had demos of [Mote](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mote),
[Unicorn HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat),
[Micro Dot pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/microdot-phat),
[Display-O-Tron HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/display-o-tron-hat), and
[Automation HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat). We also had
a [Picade](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade) set up with some retro
games loaded up, which ended up being very popular with the kids.

Friday was an education day at Maker Faire, with kids and teachers browsing the
various stalls. Saturday and Sunday was the Maker Faire proper, and both days
were jam-packed. The Saturday ended up being the busier of the two days,
although only slightly, and the rainy weather on the Saturday probably aided
that. On our stall, everything sold well, although Pi Zeros and the Raspberry Pi
Starter Kits were particularly popular. Many of the German customers buying Pi
Zeros were telling us how awkward it was to get hold of them in Europe,
hence their popularity.

We held workshops on both days, teaching how to solder the 40 pin header onto a
Pi Zero, and these were over-subscribed on both days. They ended up going down
well, I think, although it was hard to tell how many wanted to learn how to
solder and how many just wanted to get their hands on a Pi Zero!

There was an amazingly diverse range of stalls. I had a bit of time to browse
them on my lunch break, and there was everything from 3D printers (lots of
them) to midi controller gloves, and papercraft lampshades to robotic knitting
machines. Highlights for me were the flea market electronics stall with heaps
of vintage volt meters and oscilloscopes, and the make your own silver ring
workshop (which I did!)

![Maker Faire 1](/assets/maker-faire-1.jpg)

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Maker Faire Berlin. The venue was fantastic and,
most of all, the incredible range of different stalls and activities going on
really made it an exciting and special weekend.

## Pasta, pens, patches, and popsicles!

On the Thursday afternoon, after we'd set up our stall, we ended up at a little
restaurant for lunch that specialised in Schwäbisch maultaschen, essentially
big ravioli filled with meat and vegetables. I went for the vegetarian option -
one parcel with tomato and mozzarella and one with spinach and ricotta,
with a tomato and paprika sauce. It was served with mashed potato with onion,
vinegar and lashings of melted butter - pretty filling!

After that late lunch, we headed to a lovely little shop in the Friedrichshain
area called [Schoene Schreibwaren](http://www.schoeneschreibwaren.com/home.html)
that sold leather goods (made in a workshop at the back of the shop) and
stationery. I got myself a little Kaweco Al-Sport fountain pen and a leather
pencil case.

We also stumbled across a quirky little shop called
[Werstück Flickli](http://flickli.de/de/) that sold nothing but iron-on fabric
patches, with pretty much anything you could imagine on them, from spooky
skeleton cats to Mexican wrestling masks. I ended up buying a few, and even made
a return visit to buy a couple for my wife.

A couple of hundred feet away from the patch shop was what I guess you'd call
an "artisanal" (I loathe that word) ice lolly shop called
[Paletas](http://www.paletas-berlin.com). They sold some really strange flavour
combinations like lemon and cucumber, and orange and rosemary which was the one
that I had. It was delicious and very refreshing!

That evening, we headed to the Markthalle street food market for dinner. It was
a bustling place, full of every sort of food you could dream of - traditional
German Kaese Spaetzle (cheese noodles, a bit like macaroni cheese), naanwiches
(sandwiches made with naan breads), and spicy kimchee buns. It reminded me a lot
of the Boqueria food market in Barcelona, albeit on a slightly smaller scale. I
ended the night with a shot of pure ginger juice, which was actually a really
refreshing end to the meal - highly recommended!

## Computer games, communism, and curry

On Friday morning, we visited the
[computer games museum](http://www.computerspielemuseum.de) on Karl-Marx-Allee,
which seemed like a no-brainer for self-confessed retro gaming nerds like us.
As well as one of virtually every games console ever made, including some
real oddities, they had three or four mock-ups of kids' bedrooms from the eras
of the NES, the Sega Genesis, and the Commodore 64, and a mini arcade with about
half a dozen arcade games, all playable.

After that, I had a walk down Karl-Marx-Allee to the TV tower at Alexanderplatz.
It really did remind of something out of Soviet Russia - not surprising, I
guess - with big, brutalist buildings and Soviet style signage. Although it
wasn't exactly subtle, there was something strangely elegant about it.

![Karl-Marx-Allee](/assets/karl-marx-allee.jpg)

I loved the TV tower. I ended up taking photos of it every few steps all the way
down Karl-Marx-Allee, as I found new and interesting views of it.

![TV tower](/assets/tv-tower.jpg)

A quick stop at
[Burgermeister](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d947082-Reviews-Burgermeister-Berlin.html)
for a delicious Meisterburger (burger, bacon, cheese, fried onion, pickled
gherkin, lettuce and tomato, and mayo) was followed by a walk along one of the
remaining parts of the Berlin Wall - the East Side Gallery. This stretch of the
wall, around a kilometre and a half, has been turned into a gallery of street
art. Some of the pieces of art are what you'd consider graffiti, while others
are more traditional paintings - a mix of classical and more modern, abstract
pieces. The other side of the wall, on the west side, has a photographic
exhibition about the history of the wall on it.

In the evening, we went for a rather tasty curry at
[Khushi](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d1353567-Reviews-Restaurant_KHUSHI-Berlin.html),
very welcome after a long day's walking - over 10 miles!

## Concrete columns, Checkpoint Charlie, and Croatian cuisine

After Saturday and Sunday at Maker Faire, Monday was Unification Day, a public
holiday, with a celebration around the Brandenburg Gate. I'd decided that I was
going to do a mini-tour of World War Two sights: the Topography of Terror
museum, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews Of Europe (also known as the Holocaust
Memorial), Checkpoint Charlie, and the Jewish Museum.

The [Topography of Terror](http://www.topographie.de/en/) was about a 20 minute
walk away from our apartment, built on what was the SS headquarters, and next to
another short stretch of the Berlin Wall. Outside, running along the wall was a
very informative exhibition about the rise to power of the Nazis, with a lot of
detail that was new to me. Inside, there was more detail on the Nazis'
atrocities during the war, and on the aftermath of the war and the division of
Germany. I found myself literally shaking my head reading about the persecution
of the Jews and thinking about parallels in the present day. Heaven forbid we
ever find ourselves in a situation like that again.

![Topography of Terror](/assets/topography-of-terror.jpg)

Just a couple of minutes' walk away is the
[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe](http://www.stiftung-denkmal.de/en/memorials/the-memorial-to-the-murdered-jews-of-europe.html),
a foreboding arrangement of 2,711 concrete columns, slightly offset in a
grid, and at various heights. You can walk in between all of the columns, and
one thing that I found particularly interesting was that you could walk for
quite a while down one passageway without meeting anyone, and then suddenly (and
literally) bump into someone. In the middle, surrounded by the concrete blocks
and unable to see anything other than the sky above, you could almost forget
that you were in the middle of a bustling city.

![Holocaust memorial](/assets/holocaust-memorial.jpg)

[Checkpoint Charlie](http://www.visitberlin.de/en/spot/checkpoint-charlie), a
Berlin Wall crossing point between East and West, was also nearby. It's a small
wooden hut, with a sandbag barrier, American flags, a tall signpost with a
Russian solider on one side and an American on the other, and a couple of actors
dressed as American soldiers. It's replete with tacky souvenir stalls selling
American and Russian miltaria and you can pay a few Euros to have your photo
taken with the soldiers. There's even a McDonald's restaurant overlooking it,
for the full American experience. I found the whole thing a bit of a
disappointment, given that it's one of Berlin's most well-known sites.

Although it was closed due to the public holiday, I went to visit the
[Jewish Museum](http://www.jmberlin.de/en), not far away from the East Side
Gallery that I'd visited earlier. I'd read that the building itself was more
impressive than the contents, and indeed it was, so I wasn't hugely disappointed
that I couldn't see inside. It's a modern building with lots of concrete and
metal cladding, and windows at jaunty and slanty angles, strangely reminiscent
of parts of the Scottish Parliament buildings.

That evening, we ate at a Croatian grill restaurant where you could eat your own
body weight in meat for less than ten Euros. I jest... but there was _a lot_ of
meat. The strangest part was that the pieces of meat were served with a
hemispherical piece of onion filled with some sort of flaming spirit on top.
I had a slow-cooked pork rib stew, which was delicious.

## Flat whites, Finland, and photography

On our last full day in Berlin, we visited the Nordic embassies, near the
Tiergarten zoo, and the C/O Berlin photography gallery; a day of expanding our
cultural horizons.

We met in the morning at a small café called
[Oslo Kaffebar](http://www.oslokaffebar.com), an unashamedly hipster
establishment with upcycled pallet tables, cups and saucers made from recycled
coffee grounds, and oat milk flat whites. I had a flat white and a
still-melting-in-the-middle chocolate chip cookie. Lovely.

Then we headed to the [Nordic embassies](http://www.nordischebotschaften.org).
The Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, and Icelandic embassies are all
clustered together, mirroring their geography, with a common connecting building
at the centre. The central building is a beautiful three-storey concrete, wood,
and glass structure with a central atrium, exhibition space on the first floor,
and café on the top floor. There was an exhibition of Nordic design, split into
items from each country, with everything from food to clothes to homewares and
the ubiquitous salted liquorice!

After a quick lunch, we headed to the [C/O Berlin](http://www.co-berlin.org/en/)
photography gallery, where there were a couple of exhibitions being held. On the
ground floor, there was a superb exhibition of the work of Gordon Parks, one of
the most well-known black photographers. As well as commercial work for the
likes of Life magazine, Parks photographed celebrities like Muhammed Ali, Martin
Luther King, Malcolm X, and Marilyn Monroe, to name a few; some of my favourites
though were his documentary shots of life in New York neighbourhoods like
Harlem. Upstairs there was an exhibition by Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin
entitled "Don't Start With The Good Old Things But The Bad New Ones". Pages from
the Bible had words or phrases underlined in red pen, and a relevant photo stuck
on the page. I found the whole thing a bit too abstract for my tastes, and much
preferred the Gordon Parks exhibition.

On a whim, we decided to eat at a Korean barbecue restaurant called Arirang,
despite it being described by
[one Tripadvisor reviewer](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d10146956-r391744656-Arirang-Berlin.html#REVIEWS)
as being _"like a very dirty North Korean labour camp cafeteria."_ The decor, I
had to admit, was a bit odd and somewhat dated, but the food was excellent. For
those unfamiliar with Korean barbecue restaurants, the food is served raw at the
table in a shallow pan on a gas stove, and you get to tend to it as it cooks. We
had one spicy chicken dish, and one beef and noodle dish, and they were served
with various kimchee - lettuce, cabbage, sweet potato. The smell of the food
cooking right in front of you, and the communal aspect really made the
experience special, and the food was excellent. We also tried makgeolli, a
Korean fermented rice drink, which I wasn't a huge fan of, and something I much
preferred, boricha, a roasted barley tea that was really tasty.

## Beautiful Berlin

Berlin really is beautiful. I loved how diverse the different quarters were,
with distinctive characters, and the sheer number of different things to do.
You'd definitely need a good week to do it justice; the three and a half days
that I had weren't enough to scratch the surface, as I didn't get to see any of
the (supposedly excellent) art galleries or the Reichstag, or the
[Currywurst museum](http://currywurstmuseum.com/en/) (how could I miss that?!)
Still, it gives me a great excuse to go back!
